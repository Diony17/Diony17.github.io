  abstract={The optimal use of batteries in drones is a critical issue for achieving both reliable operation and maximum flight time. The key is to acquire accurate information about the state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery in runtime. Drones typically employ series-connected lithium-ion polymer (Li-Po) battery cells, whose SoC is affected by many environmental factors as well as flight patterns. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called Optrone, which maximizes the flight time of a drone while safely using the battery. Understanding the implications of the factors affecting the SoC of the droneâ€™s battery pack, we propose a three-level SoC, which is a metric for representing the SoC of a battery in runtime. We also provide various operating policies to users to improve the safety and efficiency of operating the drone. We implemented the prototype hardware and software for Optrone, and validated its operation in controlled and real environments. The experimental results in a controlled environment showed that the proposed three-level SoC poses less than 3% error and the operating policies achieved a flight time gain of 19.4%, while guaranteeing battery safety. We also observed a flight time gain of about 10% in real outdoor experiments, where the user rightly adheres to the advised Optrone policy.},
