Greetings!  
This is **Jiwon Kim**, and I'm excited to welcome you to my website!  
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence  
at Ewha Womans University, starting March 2026.

I received my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Ewha Womans University and my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Yonsei University in February 2024 ([Mobile Embedded Systems Lab.](https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr) supervised by Prof. Hojung Cha). Prior to joining Ewha, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Networked Embedded Systems Lab.](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/organisation?query=X264%3A5) at Uppsala University, supervised by Prof. Thiemo Voigt.

My research interests focus on **on-device AI, energy-aware mobile systems, and battery management systems**—spanning a broad spectrum of mobile edge research from energy storage and hardware up to the application layer.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me.

**[Recruitment]**
The Mobile Embedded AI Systems (MES) Lab will be launching soon. I am actively looking for highly motivated Ph.D. and M.S. students. Please contact me if you are interested in joining the lab.
