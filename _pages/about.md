Greetings!  
This is Jiwon Kim, and I'm excited to welcome you to my website :smile:

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Also, I am a member of the [Mobile Embedded Systems Lab.](https://mobed.yonsei.ac.kr) supervised by Prof. Hojung Cha.

My research interests focus on battery management systems, on-device machine learning, and energy-aware mobile systems. I'm proud to have published my work in top-tier conferences, such as EMSOFT, CODES+ISSS, and DAC.

Please feel free to reach out to me at [kim.j@yonsei.ac.kr](mailto:kim.j@yonsei.ac.kr) if you have any questions or would like to connect.

Thank you!
